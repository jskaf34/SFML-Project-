# SFML-Project

* A Python school project on statistics behind Machine Learning. Was asked to formulate 3 problematics and to write a Python code to give a scientific answer to them. Thoses answers are contained in the SFML_Project_SKAF_Joey_SAM_Kevin.ipynb file.
* Three research questions about pre-processing techniques that can be used to do machine learning. The first research question is about PCA and the effect it has on the performance of two regression techniques namely, linear regression and multi-layered perceptron regression. In the second question, we focus on observing the effect of the balance of different classes, in the training and the test set. We analyse the trade-of between reducing the number of datasets in the training points to balance the classes and thus reducing the number of training points and keeping a high number of training points in the dataset, regardless of the class unbalance. In the third question, we focus more on the computational resources needed to use certain complex classification models and we compare that to the resources needed to use simpler classification models. We also analyze the effect of some pre-processing techniques, like PCA on the time needed to learn with certain models.
